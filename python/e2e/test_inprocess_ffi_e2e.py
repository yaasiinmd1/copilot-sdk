"""E2E smoke test for the in-process (FFI) transport.

Starts a client over the in-process FFI transport, performs a ``ping``
round-trip through the native runtime library, and stops cleanly. Resolution of
the transport from ``COPILOT_SDK_DEFAULT_CONNECTION`` is exercised by the full
E2E suite running under the ``inprocess`` CI matrix cell, not here.

Mirrors nodejs/test/e2e/inprocess_ffi.e2e.test.ts.
